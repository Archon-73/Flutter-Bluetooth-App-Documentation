        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>Bluetooth is one of the primary ways to connect your devices wirelessly.<br/>If you are a tech guy like me and had trouble finding yourself an app on the Google Play Store that works seamlessly without throwing in a bunch of errors or that it looks like, it was built in the '80s then you are in the right place!</p>
        <p>To solve this problem, I had set out to develop a mobile app that looks modern and works effortlessly but as you know, destiny and had other plans for me. There is "NO" documentation on Bluetooth functionality for Android devices and don't even get me started on iOS.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this whole website is to help you build a working Android app that can be used to control your robots and other devices using Bluetooth Classic Modules. For this project, we will be using Flutter to develop the app and to test the app we will be using Arduino Uno Rev3 with an HC-05 Bluetooth Module.</p>
        <p>I am assuming that you already have Android Studio installed, along with Flutter, and also have a basic understanding of Dart programming language.</p>

        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <p>For this project, we are going to add a bunch of libraries. <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bluetooth_serial" target="_blank">Flutter Bluetooth Serial</a> for Bluetooth functionality. Animated Splash Screen and Page Transitions for adding a Splash Screen. Shared Preference for saving and retrieving user settings for local storage.</p>
        <p>Splash Screen and saving files are optional. However, we want to give the user the freedom to select any output for the buttons. To accomplish that we are going to save user preferences to the local storage.</p>
